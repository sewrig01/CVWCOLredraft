					<h2>Membership</h2>
					<p>Membership in this club has many benefits and it is FREE to everyone!!!  We plan to have fun  with our VW's and hang out with, help and meet others  that have a passion for VW's. You are not required to come to a certain amount of meetings or events, although, we would love for you to come and have fun at as many events as possible.    You don't need to own a VW, just have an interest in these neat cars.   You can have any type of VW or VW-based vehicle, watercooled, aircooled, buggies, rails, kits, rods, etc...
