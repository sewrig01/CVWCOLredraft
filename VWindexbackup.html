<h2>Meetings</h2>
<p>We meet on the first Tuesday of the month at 7PM at different places around the Louisville and Southern Indiana area..   Bring your friends, family or whomever as we meet for dinner and/or dessert and discuss future events, shows, cruises and anything else that may be on your mind.  Also, make sure to bring your VW if possible, if not, your normal daily driver will do.  In the Calendar on the Events tab will be the location of each month's meeting.  See everyone the first Tuesday of the month.</p>

<h2>Membership</h2>
<p>Membership in this club has many benefits and it is FREE to everyone!!!  We plan to have fun  with our VW's and hang out with, help and meet others  that have a passion for VW's. You are not required to come to a certain amount of meetings or events, although, we would love for you to come and have fun at as many events as possible.    You don't need to own a VW, just have an interest in these neat cars.   You can have any type of VW or VW-based vehicle, watercooled, aircooled, buggies, rails, kits, rods, etc...

We will have several cruises, events and one Club show throughout the year.  Our club is a FREE to join.  We are able to function from the sales of apparel and some proceeds from the annual show (V-Dub Derby).  If you are interested in joining the club and staying updated on club events, you can send an email to ClassicVWClubLouisville@gmail.com to get on the email list.  We look forward to hearing from you or seeing  you out at one of our club events.</p>
